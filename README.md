## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

**Motivation:**
With the rise in demand for organic and locally sourced produce, we wanted to build a platform that bridges the gap between farmers and consumers. Aside from wanting to make a better community, a key feature in creating this application was the possibility for future employment and convincing the employer that I am competent in C#. 

**Problem It Solves:**
Some Farmers lack a digital presence. Agri Energy offers them a space to showcase and sell their produce. It unifies a platform for small and large farmers to display their products in one location. The application also connects individuals through discussion forums. 

**What I Learned:**
While working on this project, I enhanced and regained my knowledge of C# and MVC architecture. I also improved my front-end styling skills with CSS.


**What Makes It Stand Out:**

* Big, clean visual images using full-screen [hero](https://vwo.com/glossary/hero-image/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20hero%20image,directly%20beneath%20the%20website%20header).
* SMSS storage integration for data management.
* Easy-to-navigate layout with a shopping UI.
